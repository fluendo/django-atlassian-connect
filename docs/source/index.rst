Django Atlassian Connect
========================

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download and install using pip

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install django-atlassian-connect


Contributing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you'd like to contribute, the best approach is to send a well-formed pull
request, complete with tests and documentation. Pull requests should be
focused: trying to do more than one thing in a single request will make it more
difficult to process.
